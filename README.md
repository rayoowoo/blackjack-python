# Blackjack
This is simple blackjack game in the terminal, written using Python. It was an exercise for an online course. 

Multiple players can play the game at once. You can also see each player's face-up cards. 

Future implementations include other blackjack actions (doubling down, splitting, insurance, and "soft 17").

Rules implemented are based on:
