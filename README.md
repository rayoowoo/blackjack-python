# Blackjack
This is simple blackjack game in the terminal, written using Python. It was an exercise for an online course. 

Currently it's only one player, and there's only hitting or standing as actions. Future implementations include multiple players, AI players, seeing other players' face-up cards, and other blackjack actions (doubling down, splitting, insurance, and "soft 17").

Rules implemented are based on:
